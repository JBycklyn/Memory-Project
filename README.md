## The Game and Operating Instructions

> 16 cards arranged randomly.
> the object of the game is to flip two hidden cards to locate matches.
> there are eight pairs of cards.
> if you can complete all eight matches in 12 moves or less, you will obtain a 4 star rating.
> each successive move from 13 to 16 decrements the star rating by a half star.
> if you complete the game in 17 moves, you will have a 2 star rating.
> if you complete the game in 18 or more moves, you will have a 1 star rating.
> after eight matches, a box displays your time (min/secs), number of moves and star rating.
> click the play again button to restart the game.
> click the close button to return to the final state of your game.
> click the refresh icon to reload the page.
> good luck!
